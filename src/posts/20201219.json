  "content": "2020 is coming to an end. Corona having a grip over everything in the World, here in Germany everything is shutdown again. Means no local travelling, no eating out or enjoying an evening with friends. I am on vacation now, and I am currently writing some small projects, of which I hope I can share something soon. One is a D3 driven visualization for Jira, so that you can have your reports on a website. And another one will be a small game that runs with WebGL that I can hopefully embed into this website.",
