As the title says, this is a reset.

I have been trying to force myself to create a blog that's based around the web-engine Pixi.js.
What a desaster that has been, I had all these crazy ideas of what I want to do with the page.
Let it function as a playground for my side projects, but guess what happened I quickly grew bored
of it. As with much of the things I start, the excitement is there for the first couple of days/weeks
and then quickly fades into oblivion.

Trying to push for these things as a motiviation, have so far only caused one thing for me and that
is stress. Whenever I have a project that I want to put out into the public I am forcing myself to work
on something. Yes I know that most people will say that's how you hustle and achieve things, but for me
this approach somehow does not work. I tried a pletora of things, from working with pomodoro, signing up
to Notion for task management, or Trello in that regards. Tried having a week planner on my table, but nothing
got me into a consistent workflow mode. I read articles after articles on what productivity tipps will help me
reach ultimate levels of productivity and stay motivated throughout the whole projects.

Guess what, none of them worked. Notion I haven't looked at once I signed up, and Trello well Trello is currently
used to track a side project I am helping a friend with, but more on that in another post tomorrow.

What I found to be actually reasonable in keeping my motivation going, is a simple worklog.org file I have on my
computer that I open in another frame with Emacs. And I just write everything down that I did/finished or leave open.
I move the unticked checkboxes to the next day if I don't finish them. I put remarks in there of appoitments to schedule,
or calls I need to make. And for some reason looking and this file every day makes me feel like I am making
progress.

So none of those fancy tools, with all the bling are helping me. But a simple file, that does nothing automated but is
always there without any hassle that works.

Sometimes I am surprised at how simple my mind is, yet it is constantly busy getting bored by the slightest repetition in
everyday life.

Cheers and this time for sure until tomorrow, with an update about the side project I am working on.
